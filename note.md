# Chapter 2: Software Process

Software Engineering is a branch of systems engineering concerned with the
development of large and complex software intensive systems. It focuses on:

- the real-world goals for, services provided by, and constraints on such systems
- the precise specification and implementations
- the activities required in order to develop an assurance that the specifications and
real world-world goals have been met
- the evolution of these systems over time, and across systems families
- It is also concerned with the processes, methods and tools for the development of
software intensive systems in an economic and timely manner
